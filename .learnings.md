[H-01] Wrong minting logic based on total token count across generations
- SOL-Heuristics-1 Heuristic from solodit - "Inconsistent implementations of the same logic can introduce errors or vulnerabilities."
- Bug Summary - the while condition will never eval to tru after the first generation making this function useless after the first generation of NFTs

[H-02] Griefing attack on seller’s airdrop benefits
- Had Integration tests for all in scope contracts, but missed this - should have identified the most complex/convoluted parts of the code, and started testing there
- ex/ airdrop shares involved minting/burning, buying/selling, and transferring - alot of moving parts, ID likely area for bugs (convoluted) and start tests here
- This also had a business logic component to it - so clear understand of the games rules & design decisions would have also helped
- Bug Summary - When a user mints or forges a new token, they’re set as the token’s `initialOwner` and given airdrop benefits equal to the entropy of their newly minted token. However, if a token is transfered or sold the `initialOwner` stays the same so if 'burn' is called by the new owner, the old owner's Airdrop claims will be removed. There should be a check in the burn function that skips reducing user amount if the caller is the NukeFund contract or not the initial owner.


[H-03] Incorrect percentage calculation in NukeFund and EntityForging when taxCut is changed from default value
- Straight forward Bug but contested by auditors 
When `taxCut = 10, 1/10 = 0.1 = 10%` (correct).
When `taxCut = 5, 1/5 = 0.2 = 20%` (intended 5%, actually 20%).
When `taxCut = 20, 1/20 = 0.05 = 5%` (intended 20%, actually 5%).

[H-04] Number of entities in generation can surpass the 10k number
- Key insight, `_mintInternal` (minting) and `_mintNewEntity` (forging) handle generation increments differently, root cause of this vuln:

You're on the right track! Let me help organize this into a clear explanation of the vulnerability.

# TraitForgeNFT Generation Count Vulnerability

## Overview
A vulnerability exists where the number of entities in a generation can surpass the intended 10,000 limit due to improper handling of generation counts between minting and forging operations.

## Key State Variables
```solidity
uint256 public currentGeneration;              // Current active generation
mapping(uint256 => uint256) generationMintCounts;  // Tracks tokens per generation
uint256 public maxTokensPerGen = 10000;        // Max tokens allowed per generation
```

## Vulnerability Flow

### 1. Initial State
```
currentGeneration: 1
generationMintCounts[1]: 10000 (at max)
generationMintCounts[2]: 0
```

### 2. Forging Creates Gen 2 Token
```solidity
// forge() -> _mintNewEntity()
tokenGenerations[newTokenId] = 2;        // Token marked as gen 2
generationMintCounts[2]++;               // Count = 1
currentGeneration still = 1;             // Doesn't increment!
```

### 3. New Mint Triggers Generation Increment
```solidity
// mintToken() -> _mintInternal() -> _incrementGeneration()
if (generationMintCounts[currentGeneration] >= maxTokensPerGen) {
    _incrementGeneration();              // Triggers because gen 1 is full
}
```

### 4. The Bug Manifests
```solidity
function _incrementGeneration() {
    currentGeneration++;                 // Now = 2
    generationMintCounts[currentGeneration] = 0;  // BUG: Resets gen 2 count!
}
```

## The Problem
1. Forging can create tokens in generation N+1 while `currentGeneration` is still N
2. When `_incrementGeneration()` is called, it resets the count for the new generation
3. This erases the count of any forged tokens in that generation
4. Result: More than 10,000 tokens can exist in generation 2

## Test Evidence
```
// After minting to max
Total supply: 10000
Generation: 1
generationMintCounts[1]: 10000

// After forging one token
Total supply: 10001
Generation: 1                    // Should be 2!
generationMintCounts[1]: 10000
generationMintCounts[2]: 1      // Will be reset to 0!

// After next mint
Generation: 2
generationMintCounts[2]: 1      // Should be 2 (forged + minted)
```

## Root Cause
1. `currentGeneration` doesn't increment when forging creates next-gen tokens
2. `_incrementGeneration()` incorrectly resets counts for the new generation
3. Creates a discrepancy between `tokenGenerations` mapping and `generationMintCounts`

## Fix
Remove the reset in `_incrementGeneration()`:
```solidity
function _incrementGeneration() private {
    require(generationMintCounts[currentGeneration] >= maxTokensPerGen);
    currentGeneration++;
    // Remove: generationMintCounts[currentGeneration] = 0;
    priceIncrement = priceIncrement + priceIncrementByGen;
    entropyGenerator.initializeAlphaIndices();
    emit GenerationIncremented(currentGeneration);
}
```

## Impact
- Economic: Could inflate token supply per generation beyond intended limits
- Game Mechanics: Breaks fundamental assumptions about generation sizes
- Trust: Undermines the scarcity model of the NFT collection
