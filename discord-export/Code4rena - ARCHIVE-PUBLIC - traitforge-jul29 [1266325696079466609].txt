[07/30/2024 06:42] traitforgedev
Anything that’s relative to max. Eg - 
dev1 - 100 
Dev2 - 100
Total dev weights -200

Is this correct @Deleted User? For clarification

{Reactions}
👍 

[07/30/2024 06:42] traitforgedev
Yes correct. Testnet started cheaper so we can do more for cheap


[07/30/2024 08:30] _karanel
On the google doc it is written:
The first starts at 0.005 ETH and each subsequent one rises linearly by 0.0000245 ETH until the final is 0.25 ETH.

On the website it is written:
The first starts at 0.005 ETH and each subsequent one riseslinearly by 0.005 ETH until the final is 50 ETH.

Which is correct?


[07/30/2024 08:42] traitforgedev
Where is this on the website? I think that needs to be edited. Google doc is up to date

Also, doesn't this make the person who mints the NFT last, makes a loss if he nukes?

Also in google docs, the last NFT price is incorrect.
0.005 + 9999*0.0000245 = 0.2499755 ETH


[07/30/2024 08:52] _karanel
Total NFTs are 10k, for 0.25 ETH, it needs to be 10001 NFTs


[07/30/2024 08:53] traitforgedev
it was rounded for UX, most poeple dont really care about the 0.0000245 thats missing. its easier to read 0.25. i am aware of this thanks


[07/30/2024 08:53] _karanel
alright


[07/30/2024 09:36] Deleted User
Yeah, this is correct.

On the google doc, it is written `Entropy = initialNukeFactor`

If google doc is the updated one, the max nukeFactor could be 99.99%


[07/30/2024 09:48] traitforgedev
999999/4 = 249999


[07/30/2024 09:49] traitforgedev
InitialNukeFactor is entropy/4 (max is 249999)


[07/30/2024 09:49] pickpeak1024
DevFund is HoneyPot Fund?


[07/30/2024 09:49] traitforgedev
No

Honeypot is nukefund


[07/30/2024 09:49] traitforgedev
Devfund is what we will use to pay for development


[07/30/2024 09:54] norah7603
I am confused on following statements :

`There are a total of 10 Generations (extended as the game goes on), which can be minted in parallel via a breeding mechanism.`

and

`Once Gen 1 is fully minted, then Gen 2 can only be minted.`

Which of the above statements is true? What am I missing here?


[07/30/2024 09:58] traitforgedev
Both. Forging can create next-gen entities. But direct minting can only be in one generation until it’s completed and then it will move to the next (starting at how many have been forged already)


[07/30/2024 10:00] traitforgedev
2 ways of minting. Forging and Mint page. 

Mint page starts at gen1 and only mints gen1 until all gen1s are minted. And then starts on gen2, at wherever the tokenIDs in that generation exist (eg 50 gen2’s have been created by forging, then it starts at 51)


[07/30/2024 10:01] _karanel
so there could be gen10 NFTs already in circulation even if the minting for gen1 is not completed?


[07/30/2024 10:01] traitforgedev
Correct


[07/30/2024 10:01] traitforgedev
From forging


[07/30/2024 10:01] _karanel
alright


[07/30/2024 10:02] norah7603
This make sense, thanks.


[07/30/2024 10:06] strapontin
Is the `Forge Potential` a characteristic for only Forgers or also Mergers ? 
Do the Mergers have a limit for forging Gen+1 entity ?


[07/30/2024 10:11] strapontin
I'm also having trouble with this sentence in the `Role (gender)` part of the docs :
`In total, if 50% of Gen 1 Merge, then 7,500 Gen 2’s will be produced (set as a maximum).`

Here, is the `Merge` action the same as `Forging` ? How come 7,500 Gen 2 can be produced if only 50% of Gen 1 'reproduce' ?

{Reactions}
👆 

[07/30/2024 10:14] traitforgedev
Applicable to both. You can only forge with the same generation entities and it only creates generation + 1

{Reactions}
👍 

[07/30/2024 10:14] _karanel
Please also explain this:
If forging runs out, then the next generation is minted with the genesis entropy off-by-one.


[07/30/2024 10:16] traitforgedev
2/3 of gen1 can reproduce (mergers) and can do so several times as they have a forge potential of 0-9.


[07/30/2024 10:17] traitforgedev
There are 10010 6 digit entropies in 770UINT 256’s, so actually it re starts at the entropy batches on the 10010th mint (10 of gen2)


[07/30/2024 10:19] _karanel
what does it mean for forging to run out? Forging creates entities with an entropy that is average of the two entities it was forged from. The above statement is still unclear.


[07/30/2024 10:21] ebok21
can you share the google doc?

[07/30/2024 10:21] traitforgedev
ForgePotential is how many times the entity can forge in a year, if it reaches zero they must wait till it resets the next year. 

Child entropy = (parent1 entropy + parent2 entropy) / 2
@_karanel


[07/30/2024 10:22] _karanel
yes, if the forge potential runs out, that means the entity is infertile. So if another forge is tried it would mint from the genesis entropy or the forge would not be possible?


[07/30/2024 10:23] traitforgedev
Forge will revert and nothing will happen


[07/30/2024 10:23] _karanel
okay, i got confused because it's written `If forging runs out`

[07/30/2024 10:24] l9baldur
There can only be 10,000 NFTs of a given generation?


[07/30/2024 10:24] traitforgedev
Correct


[07/30/2024 10:24] strapontin
Just to clarify : Merging == Forging ?


[07/30/2024 10:25] traitforgedev
If burn, it will not remove the genMintCount as nuking will provide a deflationary effect

{Reactions}
👍 

[07/30/2024 10:25] traitforgedev
Same thing, merging is old terminology. Did you find the term in a doc somewhere?


[07/30/2024 10:26] strapontin
Yes, in the `role (gender)` part of the docs. I put more details here : https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1266325696079466609/1267786624943783946

[07/30/2024 10:27] strapontin
Out of curiosity, could I forge 2 Mergers or 2 Forgers together that I own, or must I use one of each even if they are both mine ?


[07/30/2024 10:28] _karanel
I guess one Merger and one Forger is required as stated in the doc


[07/30/2024 10:29] _karanel
Forger can list themselves for a fee. Merger can pay the fee for forging with them and get a new Gen entity.


[07/30/2024 10:30] strapontin
So I have to pay my own fee lol


[07/30/2024 10:30] guy_in0xnito
Started a thread.


[07/30/2024 10:30] _karanel

[07/30/2024 10:33] strapontin
lol, I don't know why I expected the fees to go in some pot 😅
Actually, some of the fees go into the nuke fund though


[07/30/2024 10:38] _karanel
could be, i'm still looking at the docs, haven't seen the code


[07/30/2024 10:40] senyab
what is the incentives for the mergers to  pay the fee in order to mint the next generation Entity?


[07/30/2024 10:46] traitforgedev
Determined traits and could be cheaper. A powerful forger is worth more than a low power forger. No different to breeding IRL. The woman will pay more if the male is better haha

@ManPeach.0x in the NukeFund -> calculateNukeFactor, the initialNukeFactory =  entropy / 40, in the docs we have it in one place as  entropy / 4 and in another as  entropy. Which is it 😄


[07/30/2024 14:04] traitforgedev
It all depends on the denominator but all are correct from what I know


[07/30/2024 14:07] traitforgedev
999999 / 4 is 249999 (24.9%)
999999/ 40 is 24999/100000 = 24.9%


[07/30/2024 14:17] anonimoux2k
Hi @ManPeach.0x , about "Setting all 770 uint256 slots cost 15m gas, and due to contract & block size limits, this cannot be set in contract initialisation. Instead a function writes in entropy in 3 passes after the contract is deployed". I think it is still possible to write all 770 slots in the same tx without splitting into 3 batches because Base's block gas limit is 112.5M (much larger than Ethereum's 30M)


[07/30/2024 14:25] traitforgedev
Interesting. I will have a think about this, it’s not really a worry to write after deployment but we can definitely change to write on-deployment if that’s the case

what do you mean you don't think so it's right there (i'm talking about mintinternal and mintnew entity)


[07/31/2024 08:30] wanziskata
mint is used to "create" an entirely new NFT, whereas forge is used to combine two NFTs and create a new one, based on the stats of the two provided tokens


[07/31/2024 08:30] _karanel
One is for minting process the other is for forging process


[07/31/2024 08:33] anonimoux2k
I think the term "combine" here needs to be clarified. Forge only mints 1 new token, not burns 2 old tokens.

Hello, 
I'm not sure if it's appropriate to ask here, but I have a question.
I'm trying to use the mintToken function from the TraitForgeNFT contract which is deployed on a local Hardhat node. Since none of the default Hardhat accounts are whitelisted how can I mint an NFT for local testing?
Thanks


[07/31/2024 11:17] zdravkohr
You can advance time after the whitelist period

The price of a nft can’t overpass 0.25 ETH right?


[07/31/2024 12:03] traitforgedev
For gen1, the finishing NFT for gen2 will be 0.3, gen3 = 0.35 etc etc


[07/31/2024 12:05] granat__
ok so the maximum “priceIncrementByGen” can be 0.05 ETH right?


[07/31/2024 12:06] traitforgedev
Start price = 0.005, price increment = 0.0000245, priceIncrementIncreasePerGen = 0.000005


[07/31/2024 12:07] granat__
I mean the maximum value it can achieve


[07/31/2024 12:13] traitforgedev
Gen10 will be 
startPrice = 0.005 
price increment = 0.0000295


[07/31/2024 12:16] granat__
why 0.05? it’s not 0.005?


[07/31/2024 12:17] traitforgedev
Agh


[07/31/2024 12:17] traitforgedev
My fault it is 0.005


[07/31/2024 12:18] _karanel
Start price is always same, right?
Price increment is increasing


[07/31/2024 12:18] traitforgedev
Yes


[07/31/2024 12:18] granat__
based on what the price increment?


[07/31/2024 12:19] _karanel
Gen 10 price increment should be 0.0000695


[07/31/2024 12:19] _karanel
0.0000245+0.000005×9


[07/31/2024 12:20] traitforgedev
This is correct also. I think I need to sleep hahaha


[07/31/2024 12:21] granat__
is there formula for this or not?


[07/31/2024 12:22] waydoum
The Mint fee for generation 1 starts at 0.005 ETH and ends at 0.25ETH after 10,000. Generation 2 starts at 0.005 ETH and ends at 0.3ETH. Generation 3 starts at 0.005 ETH and ends at 0.35 ETH, and so on.


[07/31/2024 12:22] traitforgedev
This calculates the increment for each gen. Then times the Increment by how many entities there are then + 0.005


[07/31/2024 12:22] traitforgedev
But it’s also a clear pattern


[07/31/2024 12:22] granat__
so 0.05 is added after each gen


[07/31/2024 12:22] _karanel
Arithmetic progression


[07/31/2024 12:23] _karanel
More specifically "AP with common difference in AP"


[07/31/2024 12:24] granat__
and what should “priceIncrementByGen” do?


[07/31/2024 12:25] granat__
it is 0.000005  ETH


[07/31/2024 12:29] traitforgedev
Increase the increment by that value every generation


[07/31/2024 12:32] granat__
ok so in the gen 2 the price increment will be 0.0000295 right?


[07/31/2024 12:32] granat__
and so on


[07/31/2024 12:39] traitforgedev
Yes


[07/31/2024 13:17] yashpatel2003
Is it ?


[07/31/2024 13:17] yashpatel2003
Because the entity price will increase according to docs in generation 1 with this amount


[07/31/2024 13:18] yashpatel2003
The Generation 2 will have increase of 0.005 + 0.000005 which is 0.005005


[07/31/2024 13:19] waydoum
it's the incrementation price that addes up not the starting price


[07/31/2024 13:19] yashpatel2003
0.000005 this price increase is for Generations and this  0.0000245 one is for the entities in the generation right


[07/31/2024 13:21] yashpatel2003

yes it's weritten generation's price increment "increases"

Incorrect


[07/31/2024 13:23] waydoum
that"s the starting price, read carefully


[07/31/2024 13:23] traitforgedev
It starts at 0.005 always, the price increment between mints changes over generations


[07/31/2024 13:24] yashpatel2003
Okay so gen 2 will have  0.0000245 + 0.000005 as the increment price for mint right?


[07/31/2024 13:31] granat__
traitForgeNft is the owner of Airdrop?

so we should assume that for example this line:
```uint256 age = (daysOld * perfomanceFactor * MAX_DENOMINATOR * ageMultiplier) / 365;```

will not be multiplied by ageMultiplier?


[08/01/2024 10:22] traitforgedev
Correct


[08/01/2024 10:23] traitforgedev

Two thirds ... If you have 9 Roles in total it means that two thirds are Mergers (9 * 2/3 = 6) and one third are Forgers (9 * 1/3 = 3)

When nft Is created to store tokens entropy


[08/01/2024 12:12] traitforgedev
To store the tokens entropy


[08/01/2024 12:12] brevistw
This is what Docs Wolf answered:

```
The mapping(uint256 => uint256) public tokenEntropy in the TraitForgeNft smart contract is a mapping that associates each token ID with its corresponding entropy value. Entropy in this context is likely a measure or value used to represent some form of randomness or unique characteristics associated with each token. This value can be used for various game mechanics or features within the smart contract ecosystem, such as determining the outcome of certain operations or influencing the behavior of tokens.

Here's a brief overview of how it's used in the contract:

Entropy Generation: When a new token is minted, an entropy value is generated and assigned to the token. This is done in the _mintInternal function where tokenEntropy[newItemId] = entropyValue; assigns the generated entropy to the newly minted token.

Accessing Entropy: The entropy value of a token can be accessed using the getTokenEntropy function, which takes a token ID and returns its entropy value. This function ensures that the token exists before returning the entropy.


Usage in Game Mechanics: The entropy value can influence various game mechanics. For example, in the forge function, the entropy values of parent tokens are used to calculate the entropy for a new token. Additionally, in the calculateAge function from the Aging.md documentation, the entropy influences the calculated age of a token.

This mapping is crucial for maintaining the unique attributes and behaviors of tokens within the smart contract, contributing to the dynamic and engaging nature of the game or application.

According to dev no , it’s what makes the game enjoyable because everyone knows what is coming next and it create a mint race between players who want to get nft with forger role or any other special nft . So someone being smart to frontrun or mint only special nft is not an issue


[08/01/2024 19:13] granat__

Yeah look it sounds rough and unfair but in every aspect of life, the smartest, hard working or richest person will always win. It’s inevitable to avoid this, so yes a front-runner may put in the effort to get the better NFT but that is just life and if they worked hard to do so then I don’t see the issue

Arguably they deserve it more than the person who sat there doing nothing waiting for all the others to be minted


[08/02/2024 02:34] anonimoux2k
@ManPeach.0x I have a question about the purpose of DevFund. I see it is currently used to reward developers based on weight. But my question is, if the developer activity of the project is only internal to your team, then there is no need to have a devFund contract and devAddress can just be a normal EOA. And for how to divide the bonus, that is the internal work of your team/company.


[08/02/2024 02:34] anonimoux2k
Or in the future, will you guys open source completely and allow open contributors to contribute to the source code? I was wondering about this, thanks for the reply


[08/02/2024 02:37] traitforgedev
It’s easier and engrained in the contract for transparency. This is a personal choice. And yes possibly go full open source but by then it will probably be DAO run.

vm.warp(86402);
vm.roll(86402);

Only 1 between `warp` and `roll` is needed, but using both is ok

do this with foundry:

bytes32[] memory argument = new bytes32[](1)

@ManPeach.0x why should forger token holder and merger token holder be different?


[08/02/2024 13:10] traitforgedev
Otherwise people will just constantly forge with themselves, the point of forging is to literally fornicate with other people. If everybody just forged with themselves it’d ruin the community aspect and the idea in general

The second number can be between 0 and 9, randomly set.
If it is 0, the entity can’t forge. It has 10% to be 0, so 10% to be infertile

[08/03/2024 17:24] welith
To determine the probability that the 5th digit of a 6-digit number is 0, we need to consider the structure of 6-digit numbers and the nature of digit placement.

A 6-digit number ranges from 100,000 to 999,999. Each of these positions can be any digit from 0 to 9, but with some restrictions on the first digit to ensure it remains a 6-digit number.

### Analysis of the 5th Digit

- The total number of possible 6-digit numbers: From 100,000 to 999,999, there are \(999,999 - 100,000 + 1 = 900,000\) possible numbers.

- The 5th digit can be any digit from 0 to 9.

Since each digit in the number (except for the first digit) can be any value from 0 to 9 independently, the probability for each specific digit position being a particular value (0 in this case) is the same. 

### Calculation of Probability

The probability \(P\) that the 5th digit of a 6-digit number is 0 can be calculated as the ratio of favorable outcomes (where the 5th digit is 0) to the total number of possible outcomes (any 6-digit number).

1. **Total possible outcomes**:
   Each digit from the 1st to the 6th has 10 possible values (0-9), except the first digit, which has 9 possible values (1-9):
   - First digit: 1 to 9 (9 possible values)
   - Remaining digits: 0 to 9 (10 possible values each)

2. **Favorable outcomes for the 5th digit being 0**:
   - The first digit: 9 possible values (1-9)
   - The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th digits: 10 possible values each (0-9)
   - The 5th digit is fixed as 0

Thus, the number of favorable outcomes where the 5th digit is 0:
\[ 9 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 1 \times 10 = 90000 \]

### Total number of possible 6-digit numbers:
\[ 900000 \]

### Probability \(P\):
\[ P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{90000}{900000} = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

### Conclusion

The chance that the 5th digit of a 6-digit number is 0 is \(\boxed{0.1 \text{ or 10\%}}\).

This is good, but I think I saw some padding in the code (I may be wrong about it, to double check) in case the value is under 100,000 so it would still be 6 digits with 0 at first

Thanks for the explanation and the AI tip

What is the significance of `oneYear` time in `EntityForging`?


[08/03/2024 18:00] brevistw
According to DocsWolf:

The significance of the oneYear time in the context of EntityForging is crucial for managing the Forge Potential of entities within the game. This period acts as a reset mechanism for an entity's ability to forge new entities.

In the game, each entity has a Forge Potential determined by the fifth digit of its entropy. This potential dictates how many times an entity can forge new entities. Once an entity has reached its forging limit, it cannot forge again until this limit is reset.

The oneYear time period is the duration after which the forging count of an entity is reset. This is implemented in the _resetForgingCountIfNeeded function, which checks if a year has passed since the last reset for a given entity. If a year has passed, the function resets the forging count to zero and updates the last forge reset timestamp to the current block timestamp. Here is the relevant code snippet:

```js
function _resetForgingCountIfNeeded(uint256 tokenId) private {
    uint256 oneYear = oneYearInDays;
    if (lastForgeResetTimestamp[tokenId] == 0) {
        lastForgeResetTimestamp[tokenId] = block.timestamp;
    } else if (block.timestamp >= lastForgeResetTimestamp[tokenId] + oneYear) {
        forgingCounts[tokenId] = 0; // Reset to the forge potential
        lastForgeResetTimestamp[tokenId] = block.timestamp;
    }
}
```

This reset mechanism encourages strategic gameplay, as players need to manage their forging activities within the one-year timeframe to maximize their entities' potential. It also helps maintain economic balance and long-term engagement in the game by allowing entities to regain their forging abilities periodically, thus sustaining their value and utility in the game ecosystem.

did someone have issues with the remappings when setting up foundry for the project? 

I have the following remapping set: `@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/` which makes the path like this: `....../lib/openzeppelin-contracts/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/access/Ownable.sol"` so essentially the `lib/openzeppelin-contracts` is doubled when it should be just once. 

I tried setting it to this `@openzeppelin/=/` as logically speaking, it should work as now it won't be doubled but then this is the path I reach: `"/contracts/access/Ownable.sol"`


[08/04/2024 07:31] wanziskata

If my explanation about a bug is clearly explained I don't need POC right,?


[08/04/2024 15:10] namx05
I feel, adding a test PoC is +1, however If you feel not adding that, then you should atleast add a scenario based poc (:

There is always the possibility a judge won’t agree with you. Having a PoC seals the deal. There is no counter argument to a poc

ı don't think this is the case with this one. but it seems the num of subs will be high.   from the chat history, it seems some hints  that ı did not see  are shared twice in the chat, which will affect those subs if many people see them before  deletion. however ı am happy ı did not see them. I usually look at the discord every couple hours or during break time sometimes.

Sorry if late (I just prefer to work with code before Discord). But 99% of the work can be done by asking ChatGPT to convert hardhat(ts/js) tests to foundry(solidity) tests. In the latest version of ChatGPT this works "almost well enough", but if you have zero foundry experience it can be difficult to fix small issues.

when sponsor says that airdrop contract is out of scope, but there are some instances in code where it's referred. So, should we just assume that they doesn't exist?


[08/05/2024 12:31] strapontin
I would say that if a contract A not in scope is called in a contract B in scope, all bugs in the contract A are not accepted, but if for some reason it breaks something in contract B, then you could report this issue.
Need someone with more experience than me to validate my message though, I might be wrong


[08/05/2024 12:32] strapontin
Hope this doesn't hint to anything at all though


[08/05/2024 12:32] kalogerone
findings are valid when the root cause comes from contracts in scope


[08/05/2024 12:34] cryptomoon9046

i cant answer to this with yes or no cause it really depends on the context and it is different for every protocol, but typically you wanna make sure that in scope contracts interact correctly with out of scope contracts

I've written a bunch of tests with setup already in foundry can share after the audit is done! I'm only jumping on this for 2 days so very time limited but I feel like test assets are beneficial to project teams regardless so just hmu after and can share them!

The sponsor cannot confirm anything since they aren't judging.
All valid PoCs should be accepted. If your PoC is invalid though, it may be not


[08/05/2024 17:15] welith
If the PoC is valid and you show the setup, why shouldn't it be accepted?

@kartoonjoy | C4🎇🎇 if a low/QA finding is such that the it is defined in interface, but used in main contract, but the interface is out of scope, would that be counted as a valid finding ??

[08/06/2024 06:02] _karanel
Some link was posted as announcement for some airdrop by a bot (there was an "App" tag and all previous announcements were made by @ManPeach.0x himself). I opened it up on incognito and used a burner wallet, it said I wasn't eligible. I connected my hot wallet with very small funds and it said I was eligible and it was asking for seed phrase (obv red flag). 
Tried opening any text channel, messages were disabled. Tagged the team and asked about it a channel that was open, and I was kicked lol.


[08/06/2024 06:04] traitforgedev
Yup. All resolved now. We are fixing our roles and channels now. For future reference. The airdrop will not be announced like how it was. And there will be no airdrop for WEWE either so pls be careful

[08/10/2024 15:52] pfapostol
Sponsor checks before judging? Odd logic, given that some valid findings are marked as duplicates of completely different and invalid primary findings. I thought validation was just a quick evaluation/pre-sort process.


[08/10/2024 15:54] brivan
That's how judging works, sponsors go over primary issues and drop their thoughts before the judge starts going over issues. 
Still, the judge will go over all duplicates to double check.


[08/11/2024 03:07] traitforgedev
hey this may be the best place to ask. Does anybody know if Base L2 tx's can actually be susceptible to front-running? somebody told me the mempool is private therefore its virtually impossible to front-run/MEV on base. can somebody clarify as i cant find this info anywhere...


[08/11/2024 03:30] sean3416
The answer could be Yes and No. Yes currently the mempool is private; but developing decentralized sequencers is a trend currently undergoing for L2s , so when that happens, the mempool can be public. So if you plan to invalidate all the front-running related findings due to this reason, you may want to think twice about it.


[08/11/2024 03:36] traitforgedev
Ok I think I’ll mark as valid if that’s the case.

😲 🤔 

[08/11/2024 04:34] nihavent.

Especially when we had a conversation in this chat where it became clear that front-running is a feature, not a bug.

[08/11/2024 04:52] karl_38410
But I guess the judging happens on the basis of current scenarios not future scenarios. Suppose you integrated with usdc, and as they have upgradeable contracts, and they introduce fee on transfer, would a finding related to usdc being fee on transfer be validated?


[08/11/2024 04:52] sean3416
What did I speculate about? (1)The undergoing development of decentralized sequencer is a known fact (2) The immutability of deployed code is common sense. When (1) happens, (2) gets attacked.


[08/11/2024 04:53] sean3416
I'm not a related party in this. I didn't raise frontrunning ralated findings. It's up to the judge and C4 rules


[08/11/2024 04:53] sean3416
Sorry, C4 rules


[08/11/2024 05:03] _karanel
Agreed that it's a feature, however it wasn't disclosed in Known issues or design choice.
I know sponsor texted this, but Contest readme  has no mention of this, so as per past contests it'll still be better to report to be on the safe side.

As far as private mempool is concerned, I believe whatever the judge decides is fine by everyone.


[08/11/2024 05:03] sean3416
Not all front runnings are considered as "attack". There are boring cases, and also there are serious use cases.


[08/11/2024 05:09] nihavent.
What’s the mitigation that we recommend the sponsor make to future proof them self from this attack?
My issue with these being valid is it’s not the current state of the chain, it was acknowledged as known by the sponsor, and there’s not a lot that can be done to protect against it. So the submissions aren’t adding any value to the sponsor.

Obviously it’s going to be judged according to C4 rules so we’ll see what happens


[08/11/2024 05:11] _karanel
The mitigation is to not rely on only bit-stuffing. Since on-chain data is public, front running is being considered.


[08/11/2024 05:13] nihavent.
Yes but the sponsor noted that it was intended to be skill-based so the order of entropy was to be known ahead of time. That’s a design decision


[08/11/2024 05:15] _karanel
Read my previous message. I disclosed some other findings to the sponsors as well, they were aware of it. But I still reported them because they aren't mentioned in the known issues. If this was a design choice and sponsor is aware of such issues it should have been disclosed, if not you should have submitted it to be on the safe side.


[08/11/2024 05:16] nihavent.
Yes we’re both basically explaining why we did/did not submit these issues. Well played if they end up being valid. 
Best to just let the process happen.


[08/11/2024 05:18] _karanel
I know this may come off as unfair, but that's how rules are. If it isn't known, and even if the sponsor says something in discord, do try to report it rather than missing out.


[08/11/2024 06:03] decap1703
In project docs there is info "The game will be ported to Solana after a launch on ETH L1. ". So why you talk about L2?


[08/11/2024 06:05] traitforgedev
Wrong example. It was different front-running finding


[08/11/2024 06:06] traitforgedev
Where does it say this? It was supposed to be updated by CMO


[08/11/2024 06:06] traitforgedev
Minting front-running is not an issue. It’s something else somebody found.

[08/11/2024 06:08] traitforgedev
Ok Thankyou. Will get this updated. Sorry on the inaccuracy


[08/11/2024 06:08] traitforgedev
The README for the audit repo says base but our docs did not. Which is our fault


[08/11/2024 06:31] 0x0bserver
The assessment of severity should be based on the current codebase and the specific blockchain where the protocol is deployed. While there is a trend towards decentralized sequencers, this doesn't guarantee that it will materialize, especially for blockchains like Base or Solana. It's important to note that the next deployment for the protocol is planned on Solana, which also features a private mempool.

While the shift towards decentralized sequencers is possible, it remains speculative. Even if such changes occur, these blockchains might establish separate public mempools that do not interfere with private ones, protecting existing protocols from front-running risks.

Decisions shouldn't be made purely based on trends, as trends alone don't justify potential future changes. I’m not suggesting that we dismiss findings related to this, but rather that we assign severity based on the actual likelihood of such events occurring.

For blockchains like Base and Solana, the likelihood of these changes occurring is very low. As a result, bugs of this nature should be given a low likelihood or low severity rating, as such changes are either unlikely to occur or may not affect the currently deployed protocol.

Because of the SR role I know what is meant by "different front-running" (but I can't disclose it on the public channel), but honestly I don't see the difference.

And in general, it is a bad tendency to discuss private process issues in a public channel. So it is better to forget about it until PJQA.

so since only SRs can participate, others just have to wait for the results and accept our fate?


[08/21/2024 17:31] dontonka
usually yes. if you have a friend which have SR he can escalate on your behalf.

but can we at least see the status of our findings?

No, this functionality was promised probably more than a year ago, but it is not there yet.


[08/21/2024 17:52] dontonka
unfortunately, non-SR are definitely a bit (and maybe more than that) disadvantage against SRs. I'd say it's one of the single but important cons for new comer on this platform.
- Not able to participate in PJQA, which can be a big deal.
- Not able to see how classified are your issues, you are basically simply blind. When the results are out, you have no idea how this related to your findings and how does this map with your payout (or understand why you didn't get any) as the report sometimes takes months to be published.
- Not able to see what others did submit, and learn from it and about your mistakes, which helps you improve skills much faster as a quick feedback loop.

Always keep in mind that all SR where non-SR at the beginning.

You need to push through the line XD. 

Overall, I still do think `C4 is one of the best audit contest platform` out there (granted once you are SR), at the top of the list along with Cantina and CodeHawks. Without SR, maybe a bit lower due to what I mention previously.


[08/21/2024 21:27] dontonka
The most annoying part is not being able to see your issues and others when the contest is completed, as least to have a quick feedback loop and improve your learning. All other platform allow that by default (except on certain occasion, sponsor can do it private (CCIP in codehawks recently), but that is not the default procedure). So I'm sure C4 can improve this and doesn't require SR for this. SR could be mandatory only to participate in PJQA. Throwing the idea at least (cc @CloudEllie ).

In general, I also find that the cost of the platform for judging is a bit more expensive then other platforms, which take away more money from the pot from wardens to the judges/validators.

[08/22/2024 05:34] avoloder
I totally agree. It's kind a big disadvantage to not be able to see how your issue is classified, so even if you have some friend that has a SR role and could escalate it for you in the PJQA, how on earth would you know that you need to escalate your issue? You can't, since you are completely blind in this case. I think this could be solve in the way you described it. On the other hand, that might bring much more "escalations" and discussions with judges and sponsors but still achieves a greater level of fairness, imo.


[08/22/2024 05:36] pfapostol
If you can ask your friend to escalate the issue, you can probably ask him to look at how your issue is classified.


[08/22/2024 05:40] avoloder
Not if you have multiple issues, for example. Or it doesn't necessarily have to be a friend. If I see my issue has been downgraded compared to another one, which I consider it might be duplicate I could ask here in the channel someone to escalate it for me.


[08/22/2024 05:42] avoloder

yes, but from my experience. I waited for it much more than I actually use. When you write PoC, findings rarely need to be escalated.
I thought that I would learn more quickly seeing the result, but not, because it is very difficult to dig through a large number of duplicates and meaningless findings until the final result announced publicly.

thats for the initial juding, before the pjqa


[09/03/2024 00:25] ericwillworkforcryptopunks
So I submitted a few issues (before the deadline ofc) but do not see them in my user profile? Is this the case for everybody or am I missing a verification step?

Is PJQA finished?


[09/03/2024 09:21] blockchain555
when final result?


[09/03/2024 09:41] rodiontrubnikov
There are 40 + comments in PJQA with multiple issues for consideration in each comment


[09/03/2024 09:42] rodiontrubnikov
And also additional comments after the judge's response


[09/03/2024 09:42] rodiontrubnikov
it takes time 😁


[09/03/2024 09:45] rodiontrubnikov
But pretty soon I think


[09/03/2024 10:44] brivan
Yes, just to resolve all comments is not easy. There are some interesting escalations to validate/invalidate some findings,  there are some escalations for wrong dupps for example that requires the judge to go over all issues and fix the dups, ..etc


[09/03/2024 10:46] brivan
Still, I believe by the end of this week, it will be ready for announcement, the judge is doing his best

It is like that with some contests with such high amount of submissions, issues and comments in PJQA. To be fair, the judge has been relatively fast considering the amount of work needed to be done. Be patient guys

[09/10/2024 05:00] pfapostol
I think it's more about situations where something that almost everyone thought was normal game logic somehow  turns out to be a vulnerability.


[09/10/2024 06:26] avoloder
And vice versa too .. Something that almost everyone thought was vulnerability (I can remember gaming the entropy and knowing when the golden one should be minted) turns out to be a normal gaming logic and that the sponsors want participants to compete and that is normal for those who have knowledge about contracts to take advantage of it 😄  You can't predict that


[09/10/2024 10:26] brivan
This PJQA was really tough, but everything is settled. The logo is even appearing on certified warden's profiles. Should be today

@CloudEllie , @kartoonjoy | C4🎇🎇 Something is wrong with this awards list. I'am seing the logo on my c4 account , i found 1 high and 1 med, so i should at least be mentionned somewhere in 1 cents winners. But i can't find my name on the awards list.


[09/11/2024 07:45] samuraii77
Quoting:

"Please keep in mind, only wardens who received awards exceeding $0 are included in the above list, regardless of the validity of their findings (e.g. if a valid finding had a high volume of duplicates)."


[09/11/2024 07:47] samuraii77
However the text should be changed to maybe exceeding $0.01 or whatever it actually is? As if someone has a finding, it definitely exceeds $0, it might be $0.00001 but still more than 0 so it's a bit confusing tbh


[09/11/2024 07:49] granat__
I see someone is in the first 5 places with 2 high / mediums, and others are in the top 5 with 15 high / mediums, this means that the vulnerabilities of the first one are more “rare”?


[09/11/2024 07:50] granat__
they are not even unique, so i have this doubt


[09/11/2024 07:50] 0x_shahil_hussain
payout depends upon how many dups your finding has


[09/11/2024 07:52] 0x_shahil_hussain
those 2 HM has low dups compare to other HMs


[09/11/2024 07:53] 0xfarman

You can find the formula on the code4rena docs.

Only 3 of your issues were not invalidated/downgraded and they have 85-91 duplicates.
That's probably why you're not being displayed.

[09/11/2024 09:23] pfapostol
Yes, definitely.


[09/11/2024 09:23] pfapostol
Formula is:
```
Med Risk Slice: 3 * (0.85 ^ (split - 1)) / split
High Risk Slice: 10 * (0.85 ^ (split - 1)) / split
```
So for 91 this yield a lot (a lot in terms of negative power of 10)

@🦙 liveactionllama | C4  i can see i have some valid findings in the contests but I don't see my team name in the list for the rewards. Would you be able to share the rewards distribution list based on the fidings.


[09/11/2024 09:58] 4b69
Bro.....some of us this is a learning experience for us, so to make life easier for us. You can let us see our findings and why they were invalid, we can compare to the valid ones to know what we should improve, it doesn't mean you should give us the right to escalate. And be assured if I know this is wrong or these type of bugs are not accepted, the next time you aren't seeing me submitting them therefore reducing the tons of shit I report and it goes up from there

Bro. I can't do that because I'm not a C4 developer 😄 . I asked for this feature a year and a half ago when I wasn't certified. But it's probably not a feature C4 wants to implement, probably because it would make a lot of people try to defend their findings in public channels.

Hi, I'm new to the platform and trying to understand the grouping in the report. For example the report indicates that I did not find [M-05]. But I did here https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-traitforge-findings/issues/391
How does the grouping work? I can see it was grouped with [M-09] but identified the root cause/impact/fix from [M-05] which would have paid much higher rewards due to less duplication

Should be duplicate-30 [M-19] but instead it's duplicate-656 [M-06]. 
My report identifies exactly the same root cause/impact/mitigation as [M-19].

I can see the comments on https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-traitforge-findings/issues/30 got that report de-duped from 656, but my report was not despite being the same.

Would be great if anyone could provide insight as these duplications significantly affected payouts.

Explained in the message just above yours, 2M pairs of your findings are duplicated with each other so the actual valid issues are 2H and 3M


[09/15/2024 16:45] 0xtrooper
What determines the wardens listed under `also found by ...`. Should that list all wardens with issues or just a few selected ones? 
Eg. M-05 https://code4rena.com/reports/2024-07-traitforge#m-05-incorrect-check-against-golden-entropy-value-in-the-first-two-batches only lists 10 + the selected report. But the issues repo has 46 issues with that group (https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-traitforge-findings/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+label%3Aduplicate-229)

{Reactions}
🤝 

[09/15/2024 18:51] 0xtrooper
Ah okay, feels a bit strange that m05 and m09 are separate issues. As almost all of the dubs of m09 mention the issue from m05


[09/15/2024 19:02] nihavent.
Yep I was thinking the same.
If I understand correctly:
M-05 root cause: is due to the incorrect require() statement there is no protection against Golden God existing in the entropy prior to the third batch (and implicitly Golden God can be minted twice in a single gen)
M-09 root cause: due to having two mechanisms (random entropy and specified Golden God indexes), two Golden Gods can be minted per gen.

So two distinct root cause results in two unique issues. I'm sure a lot of M-09 (including my report) mentioned the root cause of M-05 but were grouped in M-09


[09/16/2024 07:14] jayeshshukla.
I submitted a bug, It was at last moment, I was in hassel as its my 1st audit. So PoC is missing but judge marked it satisfactory and sufficient quality report (which it is clearly not)

but why was it not added to the bug list ?
